Genes expressions were compared between the treatments as well as between 'GREM4' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon'. 

Pair-wise comparisons include:  
  a) GREM4_Chill compared to GREM4_Control
  b) GREM4_Freeze compared to GREM4_Control
  c) Cabernet_Sauvignon_Chill compared to Cabernet_Sauvignon_Control
  d) Cabernet_Sauvignon_Freeze compared to Cabernet_Sauvignon_Control
  e) GREM4_Control compared to Cabernet_Sauvignon_Control

Interaction-analysis were conducted to identify DEGs by comparing species ('GREM4' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon') and treatments (Chill or Freeze compared to control)
  a) Chill interaction: 'GREM4' (Chill vs Control) compared to 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (Chill vs Control)
  b) Freeze interaction: 'GREM4' (Freeze vs Control) compared to 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (Freeze vs Control)
