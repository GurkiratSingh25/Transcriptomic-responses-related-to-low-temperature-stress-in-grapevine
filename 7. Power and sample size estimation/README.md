Effect sizes and power were estimated for gene expression comparison between different treatment of 'GREM4' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon' as follows:  
  a) 'GREM4' - Chill compared to Control  
  b) 'GREM4' - Freeze compared to Control  
  c) 'Cabernet Sauvignon' - Chill compared to Control  
  d) 'Cabernet Sauvignon' - Freeze compared to Control

The excel file contains information only for the differentially expressed genes found between different pairwise comparisons as mentioned above. The average effect calculated for each of these comparisons was used to calculate the power for detecting DEGs. Further, sample size was calculated using different values of power, effect size and alpha value.
